LibreChat has a MongoDB Express database option. I wanted to parse the JSON data it output so I can see what my friends are doing on my LibreChat instance. I commented out parts that were used to alias user IDs with my friend's names.

I do not know how to program but I could bumble my way through with GPT-4-Turbo and probably $0.20 of API usage.
